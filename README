OVERVIEW:

 Concisely explain what the program does.


INCLUDED FILES:

 Machine.java - Contains the source code to building a Busy Beaver from an input file.
 State.java - Contains the source code to building a State for use by the Machine.
 Transition.java - Contains the source code to building a Transition for use by the State.
 README - The file you are currently reading.  Included for documentation purposes.


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 $ javac *.java
 $ java TuringSimulator.java
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 Give a design overview of the program. Explain the main
 concepts. Explain the main responsibilities of each class.
 Explain how the classes work together to achieve the program goals.
 
 This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
 understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
 would want to know.
 

TESTING:

 How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
 requirements? Can your program handle bad input? Is your program 
 idiot-proof? How do you know? What are the known issues / bugs
 remaining in your program?


DISCUSSION:
 
 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you 
 fix them?
 
 What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
 that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

 Extra credit opportunities were not offered.
