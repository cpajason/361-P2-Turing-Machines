OVERVIEW:

 This program takes an input file and parses it in order to create a "Busy Beaver" Turing Machine from the contents.  It then simulates the constructed Turing Machine and prints its output.


INCLUDED FILES:

 Machine.java - Contains the source code to building a Busy Beaver from an input file.
 State.java - Contains the source code to building a State for use by the Machine.
 Transition.java - Contains the source code to building a Transition for use by the State.
 README - The file you are currently reading.  Included for documentation purposes.


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 $ javac *.java
 $ java TuringSimulator TuringMachineFile
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 The program was designed from the top down.  The sample input gave a visual demonstration showing which lines of input correspond to instance data.  Then we decided which of the seven-tuple items required their own object and which would fit in primitive types.
 
 The Machine is the whole thing containing an array of states, each of which contain an ArrayList of transitions.

 Give a design overview of the program. Explain the main
 concepts. Explain the main responsibilities of each class.
 Explain how the classes work together to achieve the program goals.
 
 This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
 understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
 would want to know.
 

TESTING:

 Testing was performed using sample input provided by Dr. Sherman and a machine adapted from the textbook.
 
 The program will ignore a tape direction that is not "L" or "R," but it cannot detect a non-halting Turing Machine or an incorrectly encoded one such as transitions to non-existant states or excessive symbols.  This means the program is not protected against idiot or malicious users.


DISCUSSION:
 
 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you 
 fix them?
 
 What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
 that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

 Extra credit opportunities were not offered.
